# Ticket

An encrypted ticketing library, primarily intended for use in cookie based authentication.

Each ticket is encrypted with AES 128 bit encryption & initialization vector, then signed with SHA256 HMAC. Ticket expiration is packaged inside of the cookie and is checked when value is retrieved.


## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
[org.taoclj/ticket "0.0.1"]
```


## Usage

```clojure
(require '[taoclj.ticket :as ticket])
(require '[clj-time.core :as time])

;; generate a key
(def my-key (ticket/generate-key))
=> "your-randomly-generated-128bit-key-string"


;; issue a ticket valid for 2 minutes with value of "123".
(def my-ticket (ticket/issue my-key 
                             "123" 
                             (time/plus (time/now) (time/minutes 2))))
=> "your-encrypted-signed-and-encoded-ticket-string"


;; Easily retrieve the string value from a ticket. 
(ticket/get-text my-key my-ticket)
=> "123"

;; If the ticket value is an integer, easily retrieve the numeric value. 
(ticket/get-id my-key my-ticket)
=> 123


;; After expiration of ticket, or if the ticket has been tampered with...
(ticket/get-text my-key my-ticket)
=> nil

```
